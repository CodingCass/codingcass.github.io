			<p>Creating a website that looks great, gets found on Google, grows your email list & books clients isn’t easy.</p>

			<p>If it was, everyone would have one.</p>
	
			<p>But I’m sure you’ve come across plenty of websites that look outdated, are impossible to find what you’re looking for, and all-round make you question whether you trust the business.</p>
	
			<p>Yep, I've seen it all, and I want yours to be different.</p>
	
			<p>You started your business to share your magic with the world, not to spend your time trying to figure out #AllTheThings for a website that actually grows your email list and books you clients, so how about you leave me to handle the design and tech stuff so you can do the thing you actually love to do instead?</p>
	
			<p>I create beautiful and profitable websites for women in service-based businesses. If you want a website that looks great, gets found on Google and turns your visitors into subscribers and clients, I’ve got you covered!</p>
	
			<p>Whether you need a full website redesign or you want to freshen things up with a VIP design day, I can help!</p>
	
			<p>Spaces are limited since I only work on one project at a time.</p>

			<p>Hey there, I'm Jessica!</p>

			<p>I create beautiful and profitable websites for coaches, consultants and course creators.</p>
	
			<p>I love that I can save you the tech headache and help you finally cross “create new website” while you stay in your zone of genius, so you can have a website that makes you money without the stress.</p>
	
			<p>I’ve been in the marketing game for over a decade, and have been designing websites for myself almost as long! I’ve made ALLLLL the mistakes (and learned how to avoid them!) so you don’t have to!</p>
	
			<p>When I’m not designing, you’ll find me chasing after my kiddos, chillin’ on the couch with my hubby, watering all the indoor plants, making something crafty or binging on pizza!</p>
