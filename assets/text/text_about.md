        1. Focus on Player Experience

        2. User Research and Testing
            * Player Feedback:
                * UX designers conduct player research and usability testing to gather feedback on game interfaces, controls, and overall user experience
            * Iterative Design:
                * The iterative design process is common, where designers refine game elements based on player feedback to enhance user satisfaction

            * Consideration of Diverse Audiences:
                * UX designers in games often consider accessibility features to accommodate a diverse player base, including those with disabilities
                    * This may involve designing adjustable difficulty levels, customizable controls, and other inclusive features
        4. Menu and Interface Design
            * Intuitive Interfaces:
                * Designers focus on creating user interfaces that are visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide players with the necessary information without overwhelming them
