# Personal Website

My personal websiteâ€”comprised of my bio, portfolio, skills and contact form.

## Description

This website has gone through many iterations. It is still being iterated upon. I created my css-template repository to make this process more efficient. Early in the process, I was unsure about what the overall design of this website would be, but now I think I want it to be 1 page only and as compact as possible (without comprimising the design).
